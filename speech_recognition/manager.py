class Manager:
    """
    Orchestrates workers and a file observer within an asyncio event loop.

    This class manages the lifecycle of multiple asynchronous workers and a file observer
    running in a separate thread. It starts the file observer in a daemon thread and runs
    all workers as asyncio tasks on the provided event loop. The manager handles clean
    startup and shutdown procedures for all components.

    Attributes:
        __tasks (list[asyncio.Task]): List of asyncio tasks corresponding to worker coroutines.
        __loop (AbstractEventLoop): The asyncio event loop on which workers run.
        __workers (list[AbstractWorker]): The list of workers to manage.
        __file_observer (FileObserver): File system observer to watch for file events.
        __observer_thread (Thread): Thread running the file observer.
